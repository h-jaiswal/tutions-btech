What is Recursion? 
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. 

What is base condition in recursion? 
In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. 

What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion?

A function fun is called direct recursive if it calls the same function fun. 
A function fun is called indirect recursive if it calls another function say fun_new and fun_new calls fun directly or indirectly

// An example of direct recursion
void directRecFun()
{
    // Some code....

    directRecFun();

    // Some code...
}


// An example of indirect recursion
void f1()
{
    // Some code...

    f2();

    // Some code...
}

void f2()
{
    // Some code...

    f1();

    // Some code...
}
